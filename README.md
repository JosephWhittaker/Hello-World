##### Wii Sports Baseball

#### Baseball is one of the most popular games on Wii Sports, as it simulates the real baseball experience. Here are some tips that will almost guarantee your improvement at this game.
- On defense:
  - Vary your pitches! Use the D-Pad to influence the ball inside and outside, and try to catch the batter swinging for outside or inside pitches! A walk is      better than a home run. 
  - Throwing curveballs or screwballs that curve *off* of the plate can really be effective in striking batters out. 
  - A little known fact is that you can actually press 2 to switch your pitching style to submarine!
- On offense: 
  - *Wii* Sports is liked for being similar to real life, and your approach should be mainly the same here as it is for real baseball! Keep your eye on the ball and protect the plate!
